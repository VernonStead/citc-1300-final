                <p>I really love this one tooo. Like its amazing, i really enjoy making little landscapes and stuff but for this assignment I was told to put a human body part in the landscape so i made the eye the pond or like. And created a whole nother world on the other side of the lake. i am still very happy with this drawing</p>

                <h3>cherry tree</h3>
                <img src="images/cherry_tree.PNG" alt="blossom">
                <p>I wanted to create a background for a piece i was making but never got too, but this background was a lil difficult to make cause i put some very small details into stuff and even a lil eagle in the tree.</p>
