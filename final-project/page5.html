        <h3>Tree landscape</h3>
        <img src="images/noose.HEIC" alt="noose">
        <p>Okay... i can explain, and if this is bad please tell me and i will remove it i just kinda like it a bit, but so i drew the whole landscape and everything, right. and it is a pretty nice tree i think, like it could be much better but its still good. But i drew all this in school and ever time i draw something i know or think I can add more to what im making, and I was getting pretty mad at the school cause they were being pretty mean to me so i added a noose, they really didnt like it. but i though it looked pretty nice. Sorry </p>
